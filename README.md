# Horse And Human Classification using Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras

This project is aimed at detecting whether an image contains a human or a horse using deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either containing a human or a horse. We utilize the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to implement the CNN architecture and train it on a dataset containing images of both humans and horses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of both horses and humans. It is essential to have a balanced dataset with a sufficient number of images for each class to ensure the model's robustness.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/alihassanml/Horse-And-Human-Classification-Deep-Learning-Tensorflow-Keras.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory within the project structure.

4. Train the model using the provided Python script:

```
python train.py
```

5. Once trained, you can use the trained model for inference on new images:

```
python predict.py path/to/image.jpg
```

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing in terms of classifying images correctly.

## Results

The results of the classification can be visualized using various techniques such as confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves. These visualizations help in understanding the model's behavior and identifying areas for improvement.

## Future Improvements

Possible enhancements for this project include:

- Fine-tuning the model architecture for better performance.
- Data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance further.
